\chapter{Applications when you have networks}
\label{sec:ch8}

In this section, we'll proceed much the same as the preceding section. We'll learn how to learn from networks, but particularly in the case where you have two networks. When you have two networks, there are some nuances to analytical procedures that arise, and many special questions that you can ask between the two networks. We'll cover a few here.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch8:twosample} provides methods for testing whether a pair of RDPGs are different, the two-sample testing problem.
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch8:twosamplesbm} shows a special-case of the two-sample testing problem when the networks are SBMs.
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch8:gm} introduces the graph matching problem for aligning two networks.
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch8:vnviasgm} shows how we can identify similar nodes across a pair of networks using strategies that we developed for graph matching.
\end{enumerate}
