\chapter{Applications when you have multiple networks}
\label{sec:ch9}

In this final section, we'll cover some applications of network machine learning when we have numerous networks. We'll cover the following applications:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch9:anomaly} shows how to use network learning strategies with networks that are varying in time.
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch9:ssn_incoherent} shows how to identify edges that differ amongst a set of networks from different groups when the networks have common nodes, and how to incorporate this information to classify networks across the different groups.
    \item Section \ref{sec:ch9:ssn_coherent} shows how to use network architecture to augment the strategies of the previous section to identify more topologically coherent groups of edges that can be used to classify networks.
\end{enumerate}
