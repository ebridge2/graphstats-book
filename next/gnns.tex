\paragraph*{Co-authored with Jason Yim}

Throughout this book, we have focused on ways in which you can represent and, if desired *conceptualize*, network-valued data that place it in a context in which you can apply many of the algorithms you are used to. 

For instance, in the case of the spectral embedding in Section \ref{sec:ch6:ase}, we devised techniques which allow you to take a network of nodes and edges, and construct a tabular array with which you can learn about using traditional techniques like $k$-means for community detection in Section \ref{sec:ch7:comm_detect}, or other tasks of interest you might have. We learned how this representation had underpinnings in the $RDPG_n(X)$ random networks from Section \ref{sec:ch5:rdpg}, and how you could use this as a conceptual basis to assign explicit assumptions you might make about your network in order for you to do downstream statistical inference, such as if you want to compare two networks in Section \ref{sec:ch8:twosample}. 

In this section and the next on diffusion methods in Section \ref{sec:ch10:diffusion}, we are going to turn this approach somewhat on its head, and investigate approaches which, at face value, appear to fundamentally alter existing techniques which you already might know about, neural networks, to make them amenable to network-valued data directly.

## The drug discovery problem

In chemistry, a \textit{molecule} is a group of atoms which are bonded together. If you haven't taken a chemistry course, you can think of an atom as a building block, and a bond as the glue that holds the molecule together. Every interaction you have with the world occurs through molecules; the water you drink, for instance, is a molecule consisting of hydrogen and oxygen, $H_20$, and the air you breathe consists most of molecules of nitrogen $N_2$, small amounts of oxygen $O_2$, and trace amounts of argon $Ar$ and carbon dioxide $CO_2$. In these formulas, the letters represent a particular atom, and the subscripts represent the number of these atoms in the molecule.

Without getting too deep into the chemistry, a fundamental problem for many pharmaceutical and chemistry investigations involves the analysis of molecules that might be useful for clinical purposes. A \textit{clinically useful molecule} is a molecule which has properties which, for one reason or another, might make it beneficial for humans. For instance, if you have ever had a headache, you have probably become familiar with a molecule $C_{13}H_{18}O_2$, or Ibuprofen (Advil).

Many of the drugs that we are familiar with on an everyday basis have, it turns out, been discovered totally by accident. For a laugh, we'd encourage you to check out the discovery of penicillin from \cite{ContributorstoWikimediaprojects2023Jan}, which is a family of molecules having a core structure of $C_9H_{11}N_2O_4S$. 

Unfortunately, coming across all of these "happy accident" molecules has become more and more infrequent as pharmaceuticals have progressed. When a given condition is identified that a pharmacologist decides to attempt to devise a treatment for, they often must proceed facing several enormous hurdles for candidate molecules. The molecules must be:
\begin{enumerate}
\item non-toxic to humans,
\item an appropriate size,
\item be readily absorbed by humans, and
\item able to address the condition of interest.
\end{enumerate}

Achieving all of these aims is extremely difficult, and extremely risky in terms of time, labor, and most of all potential risk to human participants in drug trials. Determining definitive, or at least suggestive, evidence that the molecule will achieve any or all of these conditions *before* running live human tests can save the company billions of dollars and can save participants in drug trials unnecessary exposure to harm.

Running laboratory tests to screen these molecules is an expensive, time-consuming, and skilled labor-intensive process: what are the companies left to do?

Many drug companies utilize virtual screening methods in which computational methods are used to quickly search large libraries of molecules to filter ones with the desirable properties. Success in virtual screening methods are determined by the accuracy and speed of the computational approach. For instance, molecular dynamics simulates the physical movement of each atom and particle, thus providing the most accurate calculations of molecular properties, but requires an intractable number of numerical calculations that makes it infeasible to use in practice. Instead, methods have been built around succint 2D representations of molecules, further compressed in 1D SMILES  \cite{Weininger1988Feb,Weininger1989May,Weininger1990Aug} strings (Simplified molecular-input line-entry system), that summarize the structural relationships between different atoms through the chemical bonds connecting them. These $1D$ strings are known as *fingerprints* for the molecules, and are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:next:smiles}.

\begin{figure}

    \caption[SMILES string for a molecule]{A SMILES string for a molecule.}
    \label{fig:next:smiles}
\end{figure}

Using SMILES, practioners have built statistical models to estimate correlations between SMILES and different molecular properties. These traditional methods have relied on building hand-crafted features derived from SMILES and optimizing simplistic statistical models to predict molecular properties from fingerprints of the molecules. 

This too, however, is extremely labor intensive and, most importantly, requires direct human intervention to decipher the features used for statistical learning. With some clever manipulation, scientists have identified an ingenius approach to turn molecular screening into a network learning problem.

### Obtaining a network from a molecule

In our initial description of a molecule, we described that a molecule was just a group of atoms which are bonded together. How can we conceptualize this as a network?

If we think of the atoms of the molecule as the nodes of the network, and the bonds as the edges, this problem is extremely straightforward. Let's see how this would work with a single molecule of water. Remember that water has the molecular formula $H_2O$, which means that it is two hydrogen atoms, and one oxygen atom. The molecular structure of water is that the oxygen atom basically sits in the middle, and the hydrogens hang off the side. The process of turning a molecule into a network is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:next:molecule}. In \textbf{(A)}, the structure of a molecule is illustrated, which is identified through experimentation by chemists. \textbf{(B)} shows the process of turning a molecule into a network, where the atoms (oxygen and two hydrogens) become the nodes of the network, and the bonds between the oxygen atom and the hydrogens become the edges. \textbf{(C)} illustrates the network as an adjacency matrix.

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{next/Images/water_molecule.png}
    \caption{\textbf{(A)} a molecular structure for water ($H_2 O$), \textbf{(B)} a network representation of a water molecule, \textbf{(C)} the network as an adjacency matrix.}
    \label{fig:next:molecule}
\end{figure}

Given a fingerprint (the SMILES string), this molecular structure, and consequently the network and the adjacency matrix, are fully determined. The inverse is also true: given a network and the other attributes of the atomic structure, the fingerprint can be determined. Implicitly, computational strategies which produce desirable representations of the fingerprints produce a desirable representation for the network itself.


### Our network learning problem

For this section, we will focus our attention on the first hurdle faced by pharmacoligists. Provided a SMILES fingerprint for a molecule, we would like to determine whether the molecule is toxic or non-toxic.

## Preprocessing SMILES fingerprints

We will be using one of the datasets packaged in \texttt{MoleculeNet} \cite{moleculenet}. PyTorch Geometric (PyG) \cite{pytorchgeom,pytorch} provides a convenient module to access it. We first import the module \texttt{MoleculeNet} then extract the \texttt{ClinTox} dataset \cite{Novick2013Nov}. The dataset has a total of $1478$ molecules labeled with their presence or absence of toxicity -- determined from clinical trials done by the Food & Drug association (FDA). Since this is a binary classification task, we observe there are two classes.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
from torch_geometric.datasets import MoleculeNet

dataset = MoleculeNet(root='data/clintox', name='ClinTox')
print(f'Dataset: {dataset}\nNumber of molecules/graphs: {len(dataset)}\nNumber of classes: {dataset.num_classes}')
\end{lstlisting}

Let's look at a few molecules to understand their networkstructure. Each molecule has a known 3D structure and an associated SMILES string. We pick out two arbitrary molecules from the dataset, and take a look first at their SMILES string:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
mols = dataset[26], dataset[83]
[print(m.smiles) for m in mols];
\end{lstlisting}

Next, we can draw the molecular structures for the two molecules:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
from rdkit import Chem
from rdkit.Chem.Draw import rdMolDraw2D
from IPython.display import SVG

smiles = [Chem.MolFromSmiles(m.smiles) for m in mols]
d2d = rdMolDraw2D.MolDraw2DSVG(600,280,300,280)
d2d.drawOptions().addAtomIndices = True
d2d.DrawMolecules(smiles)
d2d.FinishDrawing()
SVG(d2d.GetDrawingText())
\end{lstlisting}

The molecules illustrated with the atom indices are plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ch9:gnn:ex}, column \textbf{(A)}. The networks each have a different number of nodes (atoms). Further, each node has a number which uniquely identifies that node in the molecule. These molecules have been analyzed with cheminformatics software, \texttt{RDKit} \cite{rdkit}, and also come with a set of node attributes for descriptive characteristics of that node in the particular molecule. While these node attributes are not relevant for our tutorial, they have substantial real-world applications to optimize predictive accuracy. Let's take a look at the number of atoms and the number of atomic features now:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
for i,m in enumerate(mols):
    print(f'Molecule {i+1}: Number of atoms={m.x.shape[0]}, Features per atom={m.x.shape[1]}')
\end{lstlisting}

As we discussed above, the edges of the network are the bonds between different pairs of atoms (the nodes). Using the SMILE fingerprint, we can also obtain information of the bonds of the network. Let's take a look at the indices of the bonds, shown below:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
d2d = rdMolDraw2D.MolDraw2DSVG(600,280,300,280)
d2d.drawOptions().addBondIndices = True
d2d.DrawMolecules(smiles)
d2d.FinishDrawing()
SVG(d2d.GetDrawingText())
\end{lstlisting}

Unlike many of the networks we have seen in examples so far, the adjacency matrices for molecular networks tend to be, especially for larger molecules (molecules with more nodes, or atoms) extremely sparse, a concept that we covered in Section \ref{sec:ch7:sparse}. In smaller networks, this is a rather irrelevant consideration. Remember that the adjacency matrix has, for a simple network, $\binom n 2 = \frac{1}{2}n(n - 1)$ possible edges. So, if we store the entire adjacency matrix, we need to keep track of $\frac{1}{2}n (n - 1)$ entries. 

In a sparse adjacency matrix, the total number of edges might be considerably less than this. Remember that an edge is indexed by two nodes, so if two times the number of edges is less than $\binom n 2$, we can save a lot of space by storing and operating on the adjacency matrix using edgelists.

When you have a network with a sparse adjacency matrix, you can even perform many matrix computations without ever having to construct the (potentially large) adjacency matrix in its entirety. In Section \ref{sec:ch7:sparse}, we discussed the implications directly using \texttt{scipy} for sparse matrices. An equivalent construct for graph neural networks are \texttt{pytorch} sparse arrays such as those we leverage here, which similarly operate a lot faster and more efficiently on adjacency matrices which are sparse.

With this in mind, when we look through the dataset, we need to keep in mind that the network is stored using this sparse edgelist format. To build the adjacency matrix so that we can visualize it using the traditional heatmap, we need to first construct the adjacency matrix from the edgelist, which is what we do below:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
import numpy as np

_process = lambda x: [e[0] for e in np.split(x, 2)]
def A_from_edgelist(molecule):
    """
    A function that takes molecules, and produces an adjacency matrix.
    """
    # the number of nodes is the number of atoms (rows of .x attribute)
    n = molecule.x.shape[0]
    # the adjacency matrix is n x n
    A = np.zeros((n, n))
    edgelist = m.edge_index.numpy()
    # loop over the edges e_k, and for each edge, unpack the 
    # nodes that are incident it. for this corresponding pair of nodes, 
    # change the adjacency matrix entry to 1
    for e_k, (i, j) in enumerate(zip(*_process(edgelist))):
        A[i, j] = 1
    return A
\end{lstlisting}

Now that we can produce adjacency matrices from sparse edgelists, we can convert the molecules to adjacency matrices, and then plot them using heatmaps like we are used to:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=python]
from graphbook_code import heatmap

for m_i, m in enumerate(mols):
    A = A_from_edgelist(m)
    heatmap(A)
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{next/Images/molecule_ex.png}
    \caption[Example of two molecule adjacency matrices]{\textbf{(A.I)} the first molecule, \textbf{(A.II)} the first molecule as an adjacency matrix, \textbf{(B.I)} the second molecule, \textbf{(B.II)} the second molecule as an adjacency matrix.}
    \label{fig:ch9:gnn:ex}
\end{figure}

The molecules are shown with their adjacency matrices in Figure \ref{fig:ch9:gnn:ex}. Let's take a look at this just to verify we can confirm what is going on. Notice that in the molecule shown in Figure \ref{fig:ch9:gnn:ex}(A.I), that an Oxygen atom (index $7$) is bonded to two Carbon atoms (the ``points'' of the hexagon are Carbon atoms), which each have indices $5$ and $8$ respectively. When we look at the adjacency matrix in Figure \ref{fig:ch9:gnn:ex}(A.II), looking at the row corresponding to atom index $7$ shows that it is connected to atom indices $5$ and $8$, as desired. As an exercise, you can continue this process for all of the atoms in the molecule until you are convinced that you understand what is being represented in the adjacency matrix.

So, now the take-home message; why did we choose these two molecules? Does anything look obvious to you, as a machine learning specialist with network expertise, about these two molecules?

Well, quite simply, the first one is non-toxic, whereas the second one is quite toxic! To know this, you would probably need to be somewhat of an expert in organic chemistry, which for the majority of machine learning experts, probably is not the case.

Despite the fact that you might not have background in organic chemistry, you can still be valuable to pharmacologists: it turns out that, even though you do not know a heck of a lot about either of these two molecules, nor perhaps even the field, you might know a lot about classification of network data. Let's see if we can borrow some techniques from machine learning to learn about these molecules.


## Graph neural networks (GNNs)

At this point, we've done a decent exploration into the SMILES strings, and hopefully we've convinced you that, given the SMILES string, we can recover either the molecular structure in its entirety or an underlying adjacency matrix. Now it's time for the fun part. As it turns out, using *only* this adjacency matrix, you can do a pretty good job of identifying what, to my eyes anyways, is a completely opaque task: determining whether a molecule is toxic or non-toxic. We'll show you how using an approach you may have come across before in machine learning, known as a \textit{neural network}. If you are unfamiliar with neural networks and the basic mathematics which are used to describe them, or if you need a quick refresher, we would recommend you check out Aurelien Geron's book \cite{Geron2017Mar}, which has an extensive discussion of them.

In this task, we have several problems which fundamentally distinguish this task from many of the approaches we have seen before. When we learned representations for network-valued data previously, we assumed that, as the investigator, you probably had a decent knowledge of the structure of your data ahead of time, and which assumptions might be sensible to pick out. When this was the case, you could decipher statistical models from Section \ref{sec:ch5} which might be reasonably sensible for your data (the assumptions might not be perfect, but good enough for the purposes of your investigation), and use these statistical models to facilitate downstream statistical inference tasks you want to learn about. 

When dealing with expansive molecular networks (the two molecules we picked out were rather tiny, but molecules related to drug discovery can be enormous, with dozens to thousands of atoms), we have a few problems that arise. In particular, it is often extremely unclear how to construct a direct statistical model that can be feasibly optimized or learned, as identifying the core features you want to capture with the statistical model for unseen molecules (or whatever your underlying networks represent) can be arduous, time consuming, and require domain expertise that you just might not have. A practical solution to this hurdle might be to use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). A \textit{graph neural network} is just a neural network, but modified for use with graph (or network)-valued data.

GNNs have two desirable properties that can help us to overcome some of these hurdles:

### GNNs are universal approximators

When you have a task of interest in mind, assuming that your data is informative for that task, there are features or aspects of your data (which might be extremely convoluted) that you can ``tease out'' which will give you the best possible information for your question of interest. 

These features might be simple; for instance, to classify a molecule, the presence of at most $5$ bonds might be the definitive feature that makes a molecule toxic or non-toxic. Any molecule with more than $5$ bonds could be toxic, and any molecule with less than $5$ bonds could be non-toxic.

However, in practice (and in this task), the features are not nearly that simple, nor completely understood even by the most pre-eminent experts in organic chemistry, and this problem permeates to many other fields other than just pharmacology. 

GNNs provide a framework for constructing universal approximators for network-valued data. A \textit{universal approximator} has a fairly complicated definition, so we will avoid defining it formally here. Basically the idea is that, whatever the relationship between the data (the network) and the outcome of interest (in this case, toxic or non-toxic) happens to be, no matter how complicated or convoluted it is (as long as such a relationship exists), a properly chosen GNN is always capable of closely finding the relationship \cite{Scarselli2008Dec}. The caveat is that the meaning of ``close'' is contingent on the number of training samples. Although you probably have come across the term training data before, we'll define it formally for you here: \textit{training data} is data which you will use to train an algorithm to predict the outcome you intend to study. The idea is that, if the network has enough free parameters (a function of the number of *nodes* and *edges* in the neural network, not to be confused with the number of nodes/edges in the networks that we are studying)  This is extremely appealing in fields in which we domain expertise can't help us too much, and where we have tons of training data. 

In this case, there are hundreds of thousands of molecules that have been extensively and exhaustively studied by pharmacologists for toxicity, so we have a substantial backlog of data where we know ahead of time whether the molecule is toxic or not. Further, even to trained scientists, as the molecule size grows, determining toxicity can be difficult and certainly not immediate as it can be for a properly trained neural network.

### GNNs are easy and efficient to optimize

Once you have an enormous volume of training data, you might be extremely concerned about how well you might be able to actually train up this neural network. Fortunately, there is plenty of help out there. A plethora of software libraries have been built to allow for neural network training and optimization. The success of neural networks is closely tied with the advent of special computer hardware, Graphical Processing Units (GPUs), that greatly accelerate and scale numerical calculations. GNNs are widely used in practice because they can scale to very large and high-dimensional datasets due to the tight coupling of engineering progress/technical advances in GPU performance and mathematical theory.
